# Information-Time Structure Theory (ITST)

Information-Time Structure Theory (ITST) is a **receiver-only, information-theoretic framework**
for interpreting present-accessible signals by comparing:

- **past-origin models**, and
- **future-constrained (boundary-conditioned) descriptions**

of the same observation stream.

This project does **not** propose physical time travel, retrocausality, or communication from the future.
It provides a structured method for evaluating when observed informational structure
is more coherently described by future constraints than by past-only causality.

## What This Is

- A **conceptual research framework** grounded in information theory
- A **model-comparison approach** for temporal asymmetry in noisy time series
- A **receiver-only interpretation** of observed signals

---

## What This Is Not

- Not physical time travel
- Not retrocausal messaging
- Not proof of future-origin information
- Not an experimental claim

## Core Idea (Minimal)

Given an observation stream:

x(t) = s(t) + n(t)

we compare two explanatory descriptions:

- Past-origin model:  
  x(t) = s_past(t) + n(t)

- Future-constrained model:  
  x(t) = s_future(t) + n'(t)  
  (boundary-conditioned description)

The framework evaluates which description provides greater coherence
under model-comparison criteria and temporal-asymmetry indicators.
