# Information-Time Structure Theory (ITST)

A receiver-only, information-theoretic framework for interpreting present-accessible information by comparing:
- past-origin models, and
- future-constrained (boundary-conditioned) descriptions.

## What this is
- A conceptual and reproducible model-comparison framework
- A set of definitions, equations, and evaluation criteria

## What this is NOT
- Not physical time travel
- Not retrocausal messaging
- Not evidence of future-origin signals
